# CM2116 Lab 6

## Aims

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

* Use Java Collections Framework interfaces to implement your own concrete collection types.
* Understand how different types of List data structure are implemented.
* Understand the algorithmic complexities of List operations for different implementations.

## Using the repo

You should complete the exercises like any other GitHub Classroom "assignment" you've done before. The difference now is that when you push your code, it is automatically tested and the results indicated by either a tick or a cross in the bar above the list of files. Clicking this icon, then clicking **Details** will take you to a page showing the test results.
